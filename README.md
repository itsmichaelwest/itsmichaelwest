### Hi there! 👋

My name is **Michael** and I'm a self-taught designer/developer (_yes, that's a thing!_). Currently I am focusing on completing my Computer Science course at university. I was previously a **Design Intern** at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), where I worked on a variety of products and design systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). I recently re-wrote my portfolio website in React — it was a super fun experience! I'm also learning more advanced 3D modelling and animation techniques.

💬 Ask me about design! I strongly believe in open design, and encourage co-creation that can help deliver a better solution for our users.

📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmichaelwest)!

🌍 Find me on the web at [www.michaelwe.st](https://www.michaelwe.st/)

⚡ Fun fact: I previously used to be a [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/) for Windows Design.

😄 My pronouns are he/they.
