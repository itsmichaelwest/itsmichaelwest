### Hi there! 👋

My name is **Michael** and I'm a self-taught designer/developer. I'm currently a **Designer 2** at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), where I work on a variety of products and design systems. Previously I was a Computer Science student (now graduated!) and a Design Intern, also at Microsoft.

🌱 I'm currently learning more advanced 3D design, modelling, and animation techniques. I really want to see how we can intersect 2D and 3D in interface design. On the side I am also trying to learn new languages, currently *český jazyk*.

💬 Ask me about design! I strongly believe in open design processes, and encourage co-creation that can help deliver better solutions for our users.

📫 You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsmichaelwest)!
